# Ethical Reflection – AI in Software Engineering

## Topic: Bias Mitigation in Predictive Models

As AI becomes increasingly integrated into software engineering workflows, ethical considerations are critical—especially in predictive models used for resource allocation. When such models are trained on datasets with imbalanced representations (e.g., underrepresented teams or departments), they may prioritize work unevenly. For instance, if the dataset contains fewer tickets from non-technical teams, the model may learn to assign lower priority to such issues. This can cause delays, frustration, and reinforce structural inequalities in the organization.

To ensure fairness, tools like **IBM AI Fairness 360** can be used. This open-source toolkit helps identify, measure, and mitigate bias in machine learning models. For example, it supports techniques like reweighing the training data, preprocessing for fairness, or applying bias-aware algorithms.

Regular use of fairness tools and transparent auditing processes helps create inclusive AI systems. Developers should also involve diverse stakeholders during training and testing to ensure the model performs equitably across user groups.

Ultimately, fairness is not just a technical goal—it’s an ethical obligation when building intelligent software solutions.
