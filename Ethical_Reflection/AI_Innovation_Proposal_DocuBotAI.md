# AI Innovation Proposal: DocuBot AI

## Title: DocuBot AI – Automated Documentation Assistant

## Purpose:
DocuBot AI is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the creation and maintenance of technical documentation in software engineering projects. It addresses the common issue of outdated or missing documentation by actively analyzing codebases and generating up-to-date documentation in real time.

## Workflow:
1. **Code Parsing:** Uses Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) to understand structure.
2. **NLP Engine:** Extracts meaning from function/class names and comments.
3. **Change Detection:** Integrates with Git to track commits and detect documentation gaps.
4. **Document Generator:** Produces Markdown or HTML output that can sync with platforms like GitHub Pages, Notion, or Confluence.
5. **Review Interface:** Allows developers to preview and approve suggested documentation.

## Impact:
- Saves hours of manual documentation effort.
- Boosts productivity and improves onboarding.
- Ensures consistency across growing codebases.
- Keeps documentation synchronized with source code in CI/CD pipelines.

DocuBot AI empowers teams to maintain high-quality, always-current technical documentation with minimal human effort—making it an essential tool for modern agile development.
