### How AI Improves Test Coverage Compared to Manual Testing

AI enhances test coverage by automatically generating test cases, identifying edge scenarios, and detecting potential issues beyond human intuition. Unlike manual testing, which relies heavily on predefined cases and human effort, AI-powered tools can analyze application behavior and user flows to uncover gaps in coverage. When combined with tools like Selenium IDE—which automates browser interactions—AI can recommend or execute diverse test inputs, assert unexpected paths, and adapt scripts as the UI changes. This leads to broader and more intelligent coverage with minimal manual effort. In my project, I used Selenium IDE to record and replay a login form test. While this ensures basic functional coverage, integrating AI-driven insights would allow dynamic generation of test variations (e.g., invalid inputs, boundary cases), helping catch hidden bugs early. Overall, AI complements tools like Selenium IDE by scaling and deepening the quality assurance process.
