## 📘 Contents

1. **Part 1: Theoretical Analysis**
   - Advantages & limitations of AI-driven code generation (e.g., GitHub Copilot)
   - Comparison of supervised vs. unsupervised learning for bug detection
   - Importance of bias mitigation in AI personalization
   - AIOps case study: Deployment pipeline automation

2. **Part 2: Practical Implementation**
   - **AI-Powered Code Completion**  
     Python function to sort dictionaries with manual vs Copilot comparison

   - **Automated Testing**  
     Testim.io automation for login scenarios with screenshots and summary

   - **Predictive Analytics**  
     Random Forest model using Kaggle Breast Cancer dataset for issue priority classification  
     Includes preprocessing, training, and evaluation (Accuracy, F1-score)

3. **Part 3: Ethical Reflection**
   - Bias detection in datasets  
   - Fairness tools like IBM AI Fairness 360  
   - Recommendations for ethical AI deployment

4. **Bonus: Innovation Challenge**
